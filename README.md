Write a program for multilevel queue scheduling algorithm by using link list.
There must be three queues generated and must be specific range of priority associated with
every queue. Now prompt the user to enter number of processes along with their priority and
burst time. 
Each process must occupy the respective queue with specific priority range according to its
priority and use the following:
i. Round robin algorithm with quantum time 4 on queue with highest priority range.
ii. Priority scheduling algorithm on the queue with medium range of priority and first
come first serve algorithm on the queue with lowest range of priority.
Each and every queue should get a quantum time of 10 seconds. CPU will keep on shifting
between queues after every 10 seconds i.e. to apply round robin algorithm of 10 seconds on over
all structure.
